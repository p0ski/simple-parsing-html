# simple-parsing-html
Parsing HTML using bash.

Basically, the function of the code will be to analyze the HTML code of the page. The idea is to find possible hosts in a given domain.

.wget [site.com.br](http://site.com.br) > will download the html of the site.

After downloading the site, I analyze the index by reading it.
.cat index.html

Get possible addresses and fetch something in the code fetch that to filter and pull something clean.
